# I ❤ Burgers

Well, let's just say I love my burgers ... and I wanted to put the places that sell them on a map. This repository is for that map. The project is available at [http://bgrg.ee/](http://bgrg.ee/) and additional burger location data is always welcome (and much appreciated ❤) via Pull Requests.
